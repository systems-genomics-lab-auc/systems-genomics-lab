# Systems Genomics Lab @ AUC

The [Systems Genomics Lab](https://systems-genomics-lab.github.io/) investigates the interaction between human genetics and the microbiome and the association with health and disease. The group uses genome analytics and machine learning approaches to analyze multidimensional data generated by high-throughput experimental protocols to achieve these goals.
